1. Numpy is a Linear Algebra Library for python, the reason it is so important for Data Science with Python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks.
2. Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries.
3.  Numpy arrays essentially come in two flavours : vectors and matrices
4. Vectors are strictly 1-d arrays and matrices are 2-d (Note: A matrix can still have onlt one row or one column).
