## Terminologies

---

1. **_Data Science_**
   1. It is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes , algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data
      1. Unstructured data = data make sense, but we can't pin point exact location to get particular information.
   2. is a "Concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.

2. **_Why Data Science_** ?
   1. Businesses looking to use data to gain competitive advantage
   2. Technological advancements - data storage, processing power, clouse based storage and computing
   3. Burst in Data - Internet, electronic devices
   4. The ability to take data - to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it - that's going to be ahugely important skill in the next decades. - Hal Varian.
3. **_What is Machine Learning ?_**
   1. Machine learning is a study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific taks effectively without being explicitly programmed, relying on patterns instead.

   3. In libraries there are mathematical principles to generate equations for the given scenario
4. **_Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning_**
   1. Making machine intelliegent by any means
   2. Programs with the ability to learn and reason like humans
   3. There can be explicit programming (Rule based programs)
   4. Machine Learning
      1. Algorithms with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
      2. Learn from pattern
   5. Deep Learning
      1. Subset of machine learning in which artificial neural networks adapt and learn from vast amounts of data
      2. Patterns drawn using neural network.
